# Schipol Flights Pipeline


Welcome to the Schipol Flights Pipeline repository! This project is aimed at providing a streamlined pipeline for processing flight data from Schiphol Airport. Whether you're an aviation enthusiast, a data scientist, or someone interested in exploring flight data, this pipeline will help you gather, process, and analyze information efficiently.


### Usage

The pipeline is designed to be modular and customizable. You can easily extend or modify it to fit your specific use case. Here's a basic overview of how to use it:

1. **Data Collection**: Implement data collection modules or integrate with existing APIs to gather flight data.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and transform the raw data into a structured format using preprocessing scripts.

3. **Data Analysis**: Utilize analysis tools and scripts to extract insights from the processed data.

4. **Visualization**: Visualize the insights using built-in visualization tools or integrate with external libraries.
